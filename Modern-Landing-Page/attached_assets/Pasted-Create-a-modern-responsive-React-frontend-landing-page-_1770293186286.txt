Create a modern, responsive React frontend landing page for a data generation platform named “NSdataLab”.

Design & Theme:
- Use the attached NSdataLab logo as reference.
- Place the logo on the top-left corner of the navbar.
- The overall theme should match the logo style: soft pastel gradient background, tech-inspired, clean, minimal, futuristic UI.
- Use rounded components, subtle shadows, and smooth hover animations.
- Prefer Tailwind CSS styling.

Layout & Components:

1. Top Section:
- A horizontal dropdown button at the top center.
- Label it as “Select Domain” with a required indicator (*).
- Dropdown options represent different domains (e.g., Healthcare, Finance, E-commerce, Education).

2. Prompt Input Section:
- Below the domain dropdown, add a large multiline text input box.
- Placeholder text similar to: 
  “Describe your data (optional) — e.g., Generate customer data for an e-commerce store with purchase history”.
- This field should be optional.

3. Row & Column Inputs:
- Below the prompt box, add two input fields side by side:
  - Number of Rows (min 1, max 100,000)
  - Number of Columns (min 1, max 30)
- Include helper text below each input showing the allowed range.

4. Schema Definition Table:
- After selecting rows and columns, dynamically render a table.
- Table columns:
  - Field Name (text input)
  - Type (dropdown with options like Row Number, First Name, Last Name, Email, Gender, IP Address, etc.)
  - Required (toggle or checkbox)
- Allow users to add/remove rows dynamically.
- UI style similar to the attached dark-themed table reference but adapted to the overall pastel theme.

5. Sample Data Upload:
- Add an optional “Upload Sample Data” button below the table.
- Accept CSV or Excel files.
- Show uploaded file name after selection.

6. Generate Button:
- Add a prominent “Generate Data” button.
- Center it horizontally.
- Use gradient styling matching the NSdataLab theme.
- Button should look primary and action-focused.

7. Bottom Action Bar:
- Left side: “Preview” button
  - On click, show a modal or drawer preview of ~100 generated rows.
- Center: Dropdown to select export format (CSV, JSON, Excel, SQL).
- Right side: “Download” button to export generated data.

Technical Notes:
- Use React functional components.
- Component-based structure.
- Responsive layout for desktop and tablet.
- Do not include backend logic, only frontend UI.
- Use mock data where required.
